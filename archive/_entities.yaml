# as a result of some odd space and indent you can get wrong intents and entities
# the chatbot will not be able to recognize user phrases and beat about the bushes
# and you will never notice or know the reason
# If in doubt you mus check generated json files in schema folder and of course in Dialogflow console
# I am using YAML Formatter plugin in Vim but it could also get queer
# underlying pyyaml will change yes/no to true/false and format useful lists into yaml lists.
# It will also remove all comments like this
# YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
